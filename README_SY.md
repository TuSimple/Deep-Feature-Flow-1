# Deep Feature Flow for Video Recognition

Original Project from([Deep-Feature-Flow(MSRA)](https://github.com/msracver/Deep-Feature-Flow))

## Something New

This repo is created for testing detection performance with DFF on Kitti Benchmark.
Besides, we add dff-faster-rcnn support for our tasks.

## DFF-R-FCN On Kitti

* [Kitti Vision Benchmark Suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) is a standard benchmark for autonomous driving. We test dff-rfcn on kitti mot dataset.
